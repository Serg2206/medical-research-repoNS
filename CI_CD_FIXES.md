# CI/CD and Code Quality Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Pylint Workflow Issue
**Problem**: The pylint workflow fails because it doesn't install project dependencies before running pylint.

**Current workflow** (`.github/workflows/pylint.yml`):
- Only installs `pip` and `pylint`
- Missing project dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Causes import errors during linting

**Solution**: Install project dependencies before running pylint.

### 2. Code Quality Improvements
Applied `autopep8` formatting to all Python files for better code quality:
- Improved line spacing and formatting
- Better function parameter formatting
- PEP 8 compliance improvements

## Changes Made

### ‚úÖ Code Quality Fixes Applied
The following files have been reformatted with `autopep8`:
- `main.py` - Improved function definitions and spacing
- `train.py` - Better argument formatting
- `infer.py` - Enhanced readability
- `prepare_data.py` - Cleaner code structure

### üìù Workflow Fix Required
The workflow file needs to be updated to install dependencies. See `workflow-templates/pylint.yml` for the corrected version.

## Manual Steps Required

Due to GitHub App workflow permissions, you need to manually update the workflow file:

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Command Line)
```bash
# Copy the fixed workflow
cp workflow-templates/pylint.yml .github/workflows/pylint.yml

# Commit and push
git add .github/workflows/pylint.yml
git commit -m "Fix pylint workflow: install project dependencies"
git push
```

### Option 2: Manual Edit
Edit `.github/workflows/pylint.yml` and update the "Install dependencies" step to:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install pylint
    # Install project dependencies
    if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
```

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Pylint workflow will pass**: Dependencies are installed before linting  
‚úÖ **Improved code quality**: PEP 8 compliant formatting  
‚úÖ **Better readability**: Consistent code style across all files  
‚úÖ **Professional standards**: Following Python best practices

## Note on GitHub App Permissions

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: To apply workflow changes automatically, the AbacusAI GitHub App needs the `workflows` permission.

To grant this permission:
1. Go to https://github.com/apps/abacusai/installations/select_target
2. Select your account/organization  
3. Grant "Read and write" access to "Workflows"

Without this permission, workflow files must be modified manually.
